# 2.3 State Machine Coordination and Control Signals

## Introduction

The FPGA neuromorphic system executes neural network timesteps through the coordinated operation of **four independent state machines** across multiple Verilog modules. Understanding how these state machines communicate and synchronize is key to understanding how the hardware processes spiking neural networks in real-time.

### The Four State Machines

1. **Command Interpreter (CI)** - The Orchestrator
   - **Module:** `command_interpreter.v`
   - **Role:** Receives commands from the host PC, initiates timesteps, coordinates all other modules, batches output spikes
   - **State Machines:** RX (receive commands) and TX (send responses)
   - **Analogy:** The conductor of an orchestra, setting tempo and cuing sections

2. **HBM Processor** - The Memory Access Engine
   - **Module:** `hbm_processor.v`
   - **Role:** Reads connectivity pointers and synaptic data from High Bandwidth Memory, routes spikes
   - **State Machines:** TX (send memory read commands) and RX (receive and distribute data)
   - **Analogy:** The database engine that fetches network structure and weights

3. **External Events Processor (EEP)** - The Input Handler
   - **Module:** `external_events_processor.v`
   - **Role:** Manages external spike inputs in BRAM, streams them to HBM processor during Phase 1
   - **State Machine:** Pipeline controller for BRAM read/write/clear operations
   - **Analogy:** The input buffer that receives and distributes external stimuli

4. **Internal Events Processor (IEP)** - The Neuron State Manager
   - **Module:** `internal_events_processor.v`
   - **Role:** Stores neuron membrane potentials in URAM, accumulates synaptic inputs, generates spikes
   - **State Machine:** Pipeline controller for URAM read/modify/write operations
   - **Analogy:** The computational core that updates neuron states

### Why Coordination Is Critical

Each state machine runs independently but must synchronize at specific points because:

- **Pipeline Latency:** BRAM has 3-cycle read latency, URAM has 3-cycle read latency, HBM has 100+ cycle latency
- **Data Dependencies:** Phase 2 cannot start until Phase 1 pointers are collected
- **Resource Sharing:** Multiple modules access shared resources (HBM, spike FIFOs)
- **Timing Constraints:** All must complete before the next timestep can begin

The coordination is achieved through **handshake signals** (like `exec_bram_phase1_ready`, `exec_hbm_rx_phase1_done`) that allow modules to signal their status and wait for others.

## Part 1: Conceptual Overview

### The Symphony Orchestra Analogy

Think of timestep execution like a symphony orchestra performance:

- **Conductor (Command Interpreter):** Raises baton (`exec_run` pulse), cues sections, keeps time
- **String Section (External Events Processor):** Starts immediately, fills the air with melody (streams input spikes)
- **Brass Section (HBM Processor):** Waits for strings to establish rhythm, then adds harmony (fetches pointers, then synapses)
- **Percussion (Internal Events Processor):** Listens to all sections, adds accents (updates neurons, generates spikes)
- **Stage Manager (FIFOs):** Passes music sheets between sections (pointer FIFOs, spike FIFOs)

The conductor must wait for all sections to finish their parts before starting the next movement (timestep).

### Phase 1: Pointer Collection (Conceptual Flow)

**Goal:** Identify which neurons (input and internal) have connectivity data to fetch, collect their HBM addresses.

#### Step 1: Initiation (Cycles 0-3)
```
Command Interpreter:
  - Receives exec_run pulse (from CMD_EXEC_STEP or CMD_EXEC_CONT command)
  - Sets execRun_running = 1
  - Starts performance timer (execRun_timer++)

External Events Processor (EEP):
  - Toggles bram_select (swap present/future buffers)
  - Enters FILL_PIPE state
  - Issues 3 consecutive BRAM reads (addresses 0, 1, 2)
  - Fills 3-stage pipeline

Internal Events Processor (IEP):
  - Resets uram_raddr = 0
  - Enters FILL_PIPE_PHASE1 state
  - Issues 3 consecutive URAM reads (addresses 0, 1, 2)
  - Fills 3-stage pipeline

HBM Processor:
  - TX clears completion flags (tx_done_rst = 1)
  - TX enters STATE_SEND_INPUT_READ_COMMANDS
  - RX enters STATE_WAIT_BRAM_PIPELINE
  - Both wait for pipeline ready signals
```

**Why 3 cycles?** BRAM and URAM have 3-cycle read latency. The pipeline must be "primed" before continuous reading can begin.

#### Step 2: BRAM Pipeline Ready (Cycle 4+)
```
EEP:
  - Pipeline filled, data from address 0 now available
  - Sets exec_bram_phase1_ready = 1
  - Enters STATE_READ_INPUTS (continuous streaming mode)

HBM RX:
  - Sees exec_bram_phase1_ready signal
  - Enters STATE_READ_INPUT_POINTERS
  - Ready to receive pointer data from HBM

HBM TX:
  - Already sending read commands to HBM
  - Address format: {8'd0, 1'b0, tx_addr[9:0], 4'd0, 5'd0}
  - tx_addr increments from 0 to INPUT_ADDR_LIMIT
  - Burst length = 15 (reads 16 consecutive 256-bit words per address)
```

**Synchronized Streaming:** EEP reads next BRAM address only when `exec_hbm_rvalidready = 1`, ensuring HBM keeps up.

#### Step 3: Input Pointer Collection (Cycles 5-200+)
```
Parallel Operation:

EEP (Foreground):
  - bramPresent_rden = 1 (when HBM signals ready)
  - Reads neuron group from BRAM
  - Outputs exec_bram_spiked (8-bit mask showing which groups spiked)
  - Sends to pointer_fifo_controller
  - Simultaneously: bramPresent_wren = 1 (clears read data to zero)

HBM TX (Sending):
  - Loops through tx_addr = 0 to INPUT_ADDR_LIMIT
  - Sends burst read requests to HBM
  - Each request fetches 16 consecutive pointer words

HBM RX (Receiving):
  - Receives 256-bit pointer words from HBM
  - Each word contains 8 pointers: [31:23]=length, [22:0]=address
  - Forwards to pointer_fifo_controller
  - pointer_fifo_controller demuxes to 16 ptrFIFOs based on spike mask

Completion:
  - When bramPresent_waddr == BRAM_ADDR_LIMIT
  - EEP sets exec_bram_phase1_done = 1
```

**Why Demuxing?** The 16 ptrFIFOs correspond to the 16 neuron groups (URAM banks). Each FIFO receives only the pointers for neurons in its group that spiked.

#### Step 4: URAM Pipeline Ready (After BRAM Complete)
```
IEP:
  - Waits for exec_bram_phase1_done = 1
  - Transitions to STATE_PUSH_PTR_FIFO
  - Continues incrementing uram_raddr
  - Sets exec_uram_phase1_ready = 1
  - Outputs neuron pointers for internal neurons that have connections

HBM RX:
  - Enters STATE_WAIT_URAM_PIPELINE
  - Waits for exec_uram_phase1_ready signal
  - Then enters STATE_READ_OUTPUT_POINTERS

HBM TX:
  - When tx_addr == INPUT_ADDR_LIMIT (inputs complete)
  - Sets tx_select_inc = 1 (switch from inputs to outputs)
  - Enters STATE_SEND_OUTPUT_READ_COMMANDS
  - Address format changes: {8'd0, 1'b1, tx_addr[9:0], 4'd0, 5'd0}
  - tx_select bit [18] = 1 indicates internal neurons
```

#### Step 5: Output Pointer Collection (Cycles 200-500)
```
Similar to input pointer collection:

IEP (Streaming):
  - Reads from all 16 URAM banks in parallel
  - For each neuron: checks if it has outgoing connections
  - Outputs pointer addresses to HBM processor

HBM TX:
  - Loops through output neuron groups
  - Sends burst read requests for output pointers

HBM RX:
  - Receives output pointer data
  - Forwards to pointer_fifo_controller
  - Demuxes to 16 ptrFIFOs (now containing both input and output pointers)

Completion:
  - When rx_addr == {OUTPUT_ADDR_LIMIT, OUTPUT_ADDR_MOD}
  - RX sets rx_phase1_done = 1
  - When tx_addr == OUTPUT_ADDR_LIMIT
  - TX sets tx_phase1_done = 1
  - TX toggles tx_phase (0 → 1, entering Phase 2)
```

**Result of Phase 1:** The 16 ptrFIFOs now contain all HBM addresses for synaptic data that needs to be fetched.

---

### Phase 2: Synapse Processing (Conceptual Flow)

**Goal:** Fetch synaptic data from HBM, accumulate inputs in neurons, detect threshold crossings, generate output spikes.

#### Step 1: Phase Transition (Cycle ~500)
```
HBM TX:
  - Enters STATE_POP_POINTER_FIFO
  - Waits for rx_phase1_done = 1 (already set)
  - Waits for ptrFIFO not empty (OR safety timer expires)

HBM RX:
  - Enters STATE_PHASE1_DONE briefly
  - Then STATE_READ_SYNAPSE_DATA
  - Sets rx_phase1_done = 1 (enables TX to proceed)

IEP:
  - Transitions to Phase 2 processing state
  - Ready to receive synaptic inputs from HBM
```

#### Step 2: Pointer-Driven Synapse Fetching (Cycles 500-1500)
```
HBM TX (Loop):
  For each non-empty ptrFIFO:
    1. ptrFIFO_rden = 1 (pop next pointer)
    2. ptr_addr_set = 1 (load pointer into registers)
       - ptr_addr = pointer.base_address [22:0]
       - ptr_len = pointer.length [8:0] (number of synapse rows)
       - ptr_ctr = 0 (progress counter)

    3. Calculate burst length:
       - ptr_burst = (remaining synapse rows < 16) ? remainder : 15

    4. Send HBM read command:
       - hbm_arvalid = 1
       - hbm_araddr = {5'd0, ptr_addr[22:0], 5'd0}
       - hbm_arlen = ptr_burst (0-15)

    5. When HBM accepts (hbm_arready = 1):
       - ptr_addr_inc = 1
       - ptr_addr += (ptr_burst + 1)
       - ptr_ctr += (ptr_burst + 1)

    6. If ptr_ctr[8:4] == ptr_len[8:4]:
       - Current pointer exhausted
       - Return to step 1 (get next pointer)

  Continue until:
    - All ptrFIFOs empty
    - Safety timer (wait_clks_cnt = 255) expires

HBM TX Completion:
  - Sets tx_phase2_done = 1
  - tx_ptr_ctr = total 256-bit words requested
```

**Why Round-Robin?** The pointer_fifo_controller uses round-robin arbitration to fairly select from the 16 ptrFIFOs, ensuring all neuron groups get processed.

#### Step 3: Synapse Data Reception and Distribution (Parallel)
```
HBM RX:
  - hbm_rready = 1 (always accept synapse data)
  - When hbm_rvalid = 1 (data arrives from HBM):

    Step 3a: Assemble 512-bit packets
      - 1st 256-bit word: Store in hbm_rdata_lower
      - 2nd 256-bit word: Current hbm_rdata
      - Combined = 512-bit exec_hbm_rdata
      - Set hbm_count = 1 (second word marker)
      - Assert exec_hbm_rvalidready = 1 (packet ready)

    Step 3b: Route to IEP
      - IEP sees exec_hbm_rvalidready = 1
      - Reads exec_hbm_rdata (512 bits = 16 groups × 32 bits each)
      - Extracts 16 synaptic input values
      - For each group with input ≠ 0:
          • Read current neuron potential from URAM
          • Add synaptic input: new_V = old_V + input
          • Apply neuron model (leak, reset, etc.)
          • Check: if new_V > threshold → spike!
          • Write updated potential back to URAM
          • Set bit in exec_uram_spiked if spiked

    Step 3c: Route to Spike FIFOs
      - Extract 8 synapse entries from 256-bit word
      - For synapse 0-7:
          • Check spike_flag = hbm_rdata[N*32 + 31]
          • If flag = 1:
            - Extract neuron_address = hbm_rdata[N*32 + 16:N*32]
            - Route to spike FIFO based on address[2:0]
            - spkN_wren = 1, spkN_din = neuron_address

    Step 3d: Count progress
      - rx_ptr_ctr++ (count 256-bit words received)

HBM RX Completion:
  - When tx_phase2_done = 1 AND rx_ptr_ctr == tx_ptr_ctr
  - All synapse data received and processed
  - Sets rx_phase2_done = 1
```

**Dual Distribution:** Each 256-bit HBM word is used for TWO purposes:
1. Synaptic inputs routed to IEP (for neuron updates)
2. Spike flags routed to spike FIFOs (for output collection)

#### Step 4: Spike Output Aggregation (Parallel with Step 3)
```
Spike FIFO Controller:
  - Receives spikes from 8 parallel spike FIFOs (spk0-7)
  - Round-robin reads from non-empty FIFOs
  - Forwards to spk2ciFIFO (single aggregated FIFO)

Command Interpreter TX:
  - State: TX_STATE_WAIT_FOR_SPIKES
  - While execRun_running = 1:
      • spk2ciFIFO_rden = 1 (when spike available)
      • spike_inc = 1 (add to batch)
      • Batch size = 14 spikes

  - When spike_ctr == 14:
      • Send 512-bit packet to host:
        [511:480] = 0xEEEEEEEE (opcode)
        [479:32]  = 14 × 32-bit spike events
        [31:0]    = execRun_ctr (timestamp)
      • spike_rst = 1 (clear batch)
```

#### Step 5: Phase 2 Completion and Timestep Finalization
```
IEP:
  - When exec_hbm_rx_phase2_done = 1
  - Sets exec_iep_phase2_done = 1
  - Neuron updates complete

Command Interpreter RX:
  - State: RX_STATE_WAIT_RUN
  - Checks completion conditions:
      • exec_iep_phase2_done = 1
      • spk2ciFIFO_empty = 1 (all spikes drained)
      • wait_clks_cnt == 31 (safety margin)

  - When all satisfied:
      • exec_run_inc = 1
      • execRun_ctr++ (increment timestep counter)

      • If execRun_ctr < execRun_limit:
        - Load next timestep input data
        - Loop back to CYCLE 0

      • Else:
        - exec_run_done = 1
        - execRun_running = 0
        - All timesteps complete!
```

**Safety Margin:** The 31-cycle wait ensures all spikes have propagated through the round-robin arbiters and FIFOs before starting the next timestep.

#### 3. External Events Processor - The Input Handler

**File:** `external_events_processor.v`

##### BRAM Pipeline State Machine

**States:**
```
STATE_RESET (0)       → Initialization
STATE_IDLE (1)        → Wait for exec_run
STATE_FILL_PIPE (2)   → Fill 3-stage BRAM read pipeline
STATE_READ_INPUTS (3) → Stream spike data to HBM
STATE_PHASE1_DONE (4) → Processing complete
```

**Key Transitions:**
```
RESET → IDLE:
  When: Always
  Action: bramPresent_addr_rst = 1

IDLE → FILL_PIPE:
  When: exec_run = 1
  Action: bramPresent_addr_rst = 1, bram_select toggles

FILL_PIPE → READ_INPUTS:
  When: bramPresent_raddr >= PIPE_DEPTH (3)
  Action: exec_bram_phase1_ready = 1

READ_INPUTS → PHASE1_DONE:
  When: exec_hbm_rvalidready = 1 AND bramPresent_waddr == BRAM_ADDR_LIMIT
  Action: exec_bram_phase1_done = 1

PHASE1_DONE → IDLE:
  When: Always
  Action: None
```

**Key Variables:**

| Variable | Width | Purpose | Update Condition |
|----------|-------|---------|------------------|
| `bram_select` | 1 bit | Double-buffer toggle (0=bram0 present, 1=bram1 present) | Toggles on exec_run |
| `bramPresent_raddr` | 14 bits | Read address (leads by PIPE_DEPTH) | Increments during FILL_PIPE and READ_INPUTS |
| `bramPresent_waddr` | 14 bits | Write address (clears after reading) | Lags behind raddr by 3 cycles |
| `bramFuture_waddr[2:0]` | 14 bits × 3 | 3-stage write pipeline for incoming spikes | Shifts each cycle when setArray_go = 1 |
| `bramFuture_wdata[2:0]` | 8 bits × 3 | Spike mask data in pipeline | Shifts each cycle, OR on collision |

**Double-Buffering Mechanism:**

```
Timestep N:
  Present BRAM = bram0 (reading and clearing)
  Future BRAM = bram1 (receiving new spikes for N+1)

exec_run pulse:
  bram_select toggles

Timestep N+1:
  Present BRAM = bram1 (now reading what was written during N)
  Future BRAM = bram0 (now receiving new spikes for N+2)
```

**Pipeline Hazard Resolution:**

The 3-stage write pipeline prevents data loss when multiple spikes arrive for the same address while a write is in progress:

```verilog
if (setArray_go) begin
    // Check for address collisions in pipeline
    if (setArray_addr == bramFuture_waddr[2])
        // Collision at stage 2: OR new spike with pending
        bramFuture_wdata[1] <= bramFuture_wdata[2] | setArray_data;

    else if (setArray_addr == bramFuture_waddr[1])
        // Collision at stage 1: OR new spike
        bramFuture_wdata[0] <= bramFuture_wdata[1] | setArray_data;

    else if (setArray_addr == bramFuture_waddr[0])
        // Collision at stage 0: will be ORed at BRAM level
        // (commented logic in production code)

    else
        // No collision: add new entry to pipeline
        bramFuture_wdata[2] <= setArray_data;
```

### Handshake Protocols

Detailed sequence diagrams for each inter-module handshake:

#### 1. EEP ↔ HBM: Input Spike Coordination

**Problem:** HBM needs to know when EEP is ready to stream spike data.

**Solution:** 3-stage handshake

```
Step 1: Pipeline Initialization
    EEP: Receives exec_run pulse
    EEP: Toggles bram_select (swap buffers)
    EEP: Enters FILL_PIPE state
    EEP: Issues 3 consecutive BRAM reads

Step 2: Pipeline Ready Signal
    EEP: After 3 cycles (bramPresent_raddr >= 3)
    EEP: exec_bram_phase1_ready = 1 ✓
    HBM RX: Waiting in WAIT_BRAM_PIPELINE
    HBM RX: Sees exec_bram_phase1_ready = 1
    HBM RX: State → READ_INPUT_POINTERS

Step 3: Synchronized Streaming
    EEP: bramPresent_rden = 1 ONLY when exec_hbm_rvalidready = 1
    EEP: Reads next BRAM address
    EEP: Outputs exec_bram_spiked
    HBM: Receives pointer data from HBM memory
    HBM: Forwards to pointer_fifo_controller
    HBM: Sets exec_hbm_rvalidready = 1 on every 2nd 256-bit word

    Loop: Synchronized 1:1 until BRAM exhausted

Step 4: Completion
    EEP: When bramPresent_waddr == BRAM_ADDR_LIMIT
    EEP: exec_bram_phase1_done = 1 ✓
    IEP: Waiting for this signal before proceeding
```

**Key Signal Timing:**
```
         exec_run
             │
CYCLE 0      ▼
             ├─ bram_select toggles
             │
CYCLE 1-3    ├─ FILL_PIPE (reading addresses 0, 1, 2)
             │
CYCLE 4      ├─ exec_bram_phase1_ready = 1
             │  └─> HBM RX sees signal, enters READ_INPUT_POINTERS
             │
CYCLE 5-200  ├─ Synchronized streaming:
             │  • bramPresent_rden = exec_hbm_rvalidready
             │  • exec_bram_spiked updated each valid cycle
             │
CYCLE 200    └─ exec_bram_phase1_done = 1
```

#### 2. IEP ↔ HBM: Output Neuron Coordination

**Problem:** HBM must wait for IEP URAM pipeline to fill AND for EEP to finish before reading output pointers.

**Solution:** 4-stage handshake

```
Step 1: Wait for External Events Complete
    IEP: State = WAIT_BRAM_PHASE1_DONE
    IEP: Waits for exec_bram_phase1_done = 1
    IEP: Cannot proceed until external spikes processed

Step 2: URAM Pipeline Filling
    IEP: After exec_bram_phase1_done received
    IEP: State → PUSH_PTR_FIFO
    IEP: uram_rden_0-15 = 1 (all groups reading in parallel)
    IEP: Reads neuron potentials, outputs pointers

Step 3: URAM Ready Signal
    IEP: After uram_raddr >= PIPE_DEPTH (3)
    IEP: exec_uram_phase1_ready = 1 ✓
    HBM RX: Waiting in WAIT_URAM_PIPELINE
    HBM RX: Sees exec_uram_phase1_ready = 1
    HBM RX: State → READ_OUTPUT_POINTERS

Step 4: Pointer Streaming
    IEP: Continues reading URAM (uram_raddr incrementing)
    IEP: Outputs neuron pointers
    HBM: Receives pointer data from HBM memory
    HBM: Forwards to pointer_fifo_controller

    Loop: Until uram_raddr == URAM_ADDR_LIMIT

Step 5: Completion
    IEP: exec_uram_phase1_done = 1 ✓
    HBM RX: When rx_addr == {OUTPUT_ADDR_LIMIT, OUTPUT_ADDR_MOD}
    HBM RX: rx_phase1_done = 1 ✓
```

**Dependency Chain:**
```

#### 3. HBM TX ↔ RX: Phase Coordination

**Problem:** RX must know when TX finishes Phase 1 to enable Phase 2. TX must know when RX finishes Phase 1 to start popping ptrFIFO.

**Solution:** Cross-phase completion flags

```
Phase 1:
    TX: Sends input pointer read commands
    TX: When tx_addr == INPUT_ADDR_LIMIT:
        tx_select_inc = 1, State → SEND_OUTPUT_READ_COMMANDS
    TX: Sends output pointer read commands
    TX: When tx_addr == OUTPUT_ADDR_LIMIT:
        State → PHASE1_DONE
        tx_phase1_done = 1 ✓
        tx_phase_inc = 1 (toggle tx_phase: 0 → 1)
        State → POP_POINTER_FIFO

    RX: Receives input pointer data
    RX: When rx_addr == {INPUT_ADDR_LIMIT, INPUT_ADDR_MOD}:
        State → WAIT_URAM_PIPELINE
    RX: Waits for exec_uram_phase1_ready = 1
    RX: Receives output pointer data
    RX: When rx_addr == {OUTPUT_ADDR_LIMIT, OUTPUT_ADDR_MOD}:
        State → PHASE1_DONE
        rx_phase1_done = 1 ✓

Phase 1 → Phase 2 Transition:
    TX: State = POP_POINTER_FIFO
    TX: Checks: rx_phase1_done = 1 (RX finished receiving pointers)
    TX: Checks: ptrFIFO not empty (has pointers to fetch)
    TX: If both conditions met:
        ptrFIFO_rden = 1, ptr_addr_set = 1
        State → SEND_POINTER_READ_COMMANDS

    RX: State = READ_SYNAPSE_DATA
    RX: hbm_rready = 1 (always accept synapse data)

Phase 2:
    TX: Loops through all ptrFIFO pointers
    TX: Sends synapse read commands
    TX: tx_ptr_ctr increments with each burst
    TX: When all ptrFIFOs empty (or timer expires):
        State → PHASE2_DONE
        tx_phase2_done = 1 ✓

    RX: Receives synapse data
    RX: rx_ptr_ctr increments with each 256-bit word
    RX: When tx_phase2_done = 1 AND rx_ptr_ctr == tx_ptr_ctr:
        State → PHASE2_DONE
        rx_phase2_done = 1 ✓

Phase 2 Complete:
    Both TX and RX return to IDLE
    Ready for next exec_run pulse
```

**Counter Synchronization:**
```
TX maintains: tx_ptr_ctr (total 256-bit words requested)
RX maintains: rx_ptr_ctr (total 256-bit words received)

Completion condition: (tx_phase2_done = 1) AND (rx_ptr_ctr == tx_ptr_ctr)

This ensures ALL synapse data has been received before proceeding.
```

#### 4. HBM ↔ IEP: Synaptic Data Streaming

**Problem:** IEP needs continuous stream of synaptic inputs, synchronized with HBM data arrival.

**Solution:** Data-valid handshake with automatic flow control

```
HBM RX Phase 2:
    • State = READ_SYNAPSE_DATA
    • hbm_rready = 1 (always ready to accept from HBM)
    • When hbm_rvalid = 1 (HBM data arrives):

        Packet Assembly:
        Cycle N:   hbm_count = 0
                   hbm_rdata_lower = hbm_rdata (256 bits)
        Cycle N+1: hbm_count = 1
                   exec_hbm_rdata = {hbm_rdata, hbm_rdata_lower} (512 bits)
                   exec_hbm_rvalidready = 1 ✓

        • Check backpressure: !hbmFIFO_full
        • If full: wait (stall pipeline)

IEP Phase 2:
    • Continuously monitors exec_hbm_rvalidready
    • When exec_hbm_rvalidready = 1:

        hbm2iep_rden = 1 (consume packet)

        Extract 16 group inputs:
        • exec_hbm_rdata[31:0]    → group 0 (upper/lower)
        • exec_hbm_rdata[63:32]   → group 1
        • ...
        • exec_hbm_rdata[511:480] → group 15

        For each group:
        • Read URAM (current neuron potential)
        • Add synaptic input
        • Apply neuron model
        • Check threshold → spike?
        • Write updated potential back to URAM

        • If spike: exec_uram_spiked[group] = 1

Completion:
    HBM RX: exec_hbm_rx_phase2_done = 1
    IEP: Sees signal, sets exec_iep_phase2_done = 1
```

## Conclusion

The state machine coordination in this neuromorphic system is a carefully orchestrated dance of four independent modules, synchronized through handshake signals and completion flags. The key insights are:

1. **Pipeline Priming:** BRAM and URAM require 3-cycle pipeline fills before streaming can begin
2. **Two-Phase Architecture:** Phase 1 collects connectivity pointers, Phase 2 processes synaptic data
3. **Handshake Synchronization:** Modules wait for `exec_*_ready` and `exec_*_done` signals
4. **FIFO Buffering:** Pointer FIFOs and spike FIFOs decouple pipeline stages
5. **Safety Margins:** Wait counters prevent race conditions and ensure complete data drainage

Understanding this coordination is essential for:
- **Debugging:** Knowing where to look when execution stalls
- **Optimization:** Identifying bottlenecks in the pipeline
- **Extension:** Adding new modules or modifying behavior
- **Verification:** Ensuring timing requirements are met

**Total Duration:** ~500-1500 cycles per timestep (2.2-6.7 μs @ 225 MHz)

**Key Performance Factors:**
- HBM latency (~100 cycles for first word)
- Synaptic fanout (more connections = more Phase 2 time)
- Spike rate (more spikes = more pointer fetches)
- FIFO depths (prevent backpressure stalls)
